# AGENTS.md — Cloud Workstation Project Context & Agent Workflows

This project manages the lifecycle and configuration of a Cloud Workstation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides a high-performance development environment with a Sway (Wayland) desktop, accessible remotely via Chrome Remote Desktop.

## Project Overview

-   **Purpose:** To provide a consistent, high-performance development environment in the cloud.
-   **Core Technologies:**
    -   **GCP Services:** Cloud Workstations, Cloud Build, Cloud Scheduler, Artifact Registry, Cloud Functions.
    -   **Desktop Environment:** Sway (Wayland) nested inside a virtual X11 server on display `:20` using Chrome Remote Desktop.
    -   **Package Management:** Nix (Home Manager) for persistent tool installation on the home directory.
    -   **Shell:** ZSH + Starship, tmux.
    -   **Containerization:** Docker for the base workstation image.
    -   **Profiles:** Composable installation profiles (`minimal`, `dev`, `ai`, `full`) to control build time and features.

## Project Structure

-   `workstation-image/`: Contains the definition of the workstation environment.
    -   `Dockerfile`: Defines the base system (Ubuntu-based).
    -   `boot/`: Numbered shell scripts (`01-12`) that run sequentially during the workstation's bootstrap process. These handle Nix restoration, service setup, app installation, synchronization, verification tests, and Chrome Remote Desktop setup.
    -   `configs/`: Configuration files for Sway, waybar, tmux, nvim, etc.
    -   `scripts/`: Internal scripts like `claude-tmux` and `snippet-picker`.
-   `scripts/`: Management scripts for the GCP infrastructure.
    -   `ws.sh`: The primary entry point for `setup` and `teardown` of all GCP resources.
    -   `cloud-build-setup.sh`: The script executed inside Cloud Build to provision the infrastructure and build the image.
-   `docs/`: Extensive documentation, including feature specifications (`specs/`) and progress tracking.
-   `dev-fonts/`: A collection of developer-focused fonts (Operator Mono, Cascadia Code, etc.) installed during the boot process.
-   `cloudbuild/`: YAML definitions for Cloud Build jobs.

### Workstation Bootstrap

When the workstation container starts, it executes `/google/scripts/entrypoint.sh` (from the base image), which eventually triggers the bootstrap process in `workstation-image/boot/setup.sh`.

1.  **Nix Restoration (`01-nix.sh`):** Bind-mounts the persistent Nix store from `/home/user/nix` to `/nix` to ensure package persistence.
2.  **NVIDIA GPU Setup (`02-nvidia.sh`):** Configures library paths for host GPU driver compatibility when a GPU is attached.
3.  **Service Setup (`03-sway.sh`):** Configures and starts `sway-desktop` (headless) and `wayvnc` as systemd user services.
4.  **Font Deployment (`04-fonts.sh`):** Deploys custom developer fonts to the persistent home directory.
5.  **Shell Configuration (`05-shell.sh`):** Configures ZSH shell preferences, plugins, and custom aliases.
6.  **Terminal Prompt (`06-prompt.sh`):** Configures the Starship prompt and the `foot` terminal emulator styling.
7.  **Tailscale VPN (`06a-tailscale.sh`):** Sets up Tailscale client for secure networking if a Tailscale authentication key is present.
8.  **Tmux Multiplexer (`06b-tmux.sh`):** Sets up tmux with a Tokyo Night aesthetic, custom mappings, and helper utilities.
9.  **App Installation (`07-apps.sh`):** Installs AI tools and application updates (runs asynchronously as a systemd service).
10. **Language dependencies (`07a-lang-deps.sh`):** Sets up development libraries for language runtimes.
11. **Language runtimes (`07b-languages.sh`):** Installs runtimes (Go, Rust, Python, Ruby) using direct binaries or local managers (pyenv, rbenv, rustup).
12. **Auto-Launch (`08-workspaces.sh`):** Opens default apps across Sway workspaces (Antigravity IDE on ws1, VS Code on ws2, Terminal on ws3, Chrome on ws4).
13. **Snippet Picker (`09-snippets.sh`):** Configures the lightweight snippet picker utility and custom configuration.
14. **Sway Sync (`09-sync.sh`):** Synchronizes boot scripts and Sway config from the git repo on every boot to apply changes.
15. **Application Launcher (`09-wofi.sh`):** Deploys wofi menu with Tokyo Night colors.
16. **Environment Verification (`10-tests.sh`):** Runs 190+ automated integration tests to ensure workspace health (results at `~/logs/boot-test-results.txt`).
17. **Custom Tools (`11-custom-tools.sh`):** Deploys custom CLI binaries (Terraform, gh, etc.) and sets up the `gh` wrapper to prevent dummy GITHUB_TOKEN overrides.
18. **Chrome Remote Desktop (`12-crd.sh`):** Provisions Chrome Remote Desktop, configures a nested Sway display session on `:20`, and deploys the `crd-resize` utility.

## Useful Commands

-   **Connect to Workstation:** Get the URL via `gcloud workstations describe dev-workstation --format="value(host)"` and open in a browser.
-   **Tailscale SSH:** If configured, SSH via `ssh user@<tailscale-hostname>`.
-   **Debug Bootstrap:** Logs are visible via `journalctl` or by checking the output of the bootstrap scripts during start-up.
-   **Run Boot Tests Manually:** `bash /home/user/boot/10-tests.sh`.
-   **Resize CRD Session Resolution:** Run `crd-resize <width> <height>` (e.g., `crd-resize 2560 1440`) within a Chrome Remote Desktop session to adjust both X11 resolution and nested Sway output.

## Maintenance

-   **Updating the Image:** Modify the `Dockerfile` or boot scripts and re-run `bash scripts/ws.sh setup`. Cloud Build will rebuild the image and update the workstation configuration.
-   **Adding New Modules:** Add the module logic to `workstation-image/scripts/ws-modules.sh` and update the mapping in `workstation-image/boot/setup.sh`.

# Cloud Workstation — Project Instructions

## Project Overview

Build a Cloud Workstation in GCP. The Cloud Workstation machine should have 32GB RAM as well as 250GB SSD drive. The 250GB SSD drive is a persistent disk with HOME folder mounted to it. All apps must be installed inside the persistent disk. The main docker image should be minimal so all changes, app installs persist inside the persistent disk. The base OS is Ubuntu with Nix as the package manager.

- **Organization:** `your-org.example.com`
- **Region:** `us-central1` (primary)

### Workstation Resources

The project has two clusters sharing the same VPC. **Never run builds or tests against the live workstation.**

| Cluster | Config | Workstation | Purpose |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `main-cluster` | `sway-config` | `sway-workstation` | **LIVE — do NOT target with builds/tests.** This is the PO's active development workstation. |
| `main-cluster` | `dev-config` | `my-workstation` | Legacy (stopped). |
| `workstation-cluster` | `ws-config` | `dev-workstation` | **TEST target.** All `ws.sh setup` builds and E2E tests run against this workstation. |

The setup script (`scripts/cloud-build-setup.sh`) is configured to target `workstation-cluster / ws-config / dev-workstation` (lines 41-43). This is intentional — it keeps build/test cycles isolated from the live workstation.


### Service Accounts

| Account | Email | Role | Purpose |
|---------|-------|------|---------|
| **owner-sa** | `owner-sa@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | Owner | Full project admin — used by Platform Engineer for all GCP operations |

### Credentials

- **`owner-sa-key.json`** — Owner SA key. Used for all `gcloud` CLI interactions. **Never use `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`** — always reference the key file directly (e.g., `--key-file=owner-sa-key.json` or load explicitly in code).
- Protected by `.gitignore` pattern `*-sa-key.json`. **Never commit these.**

## Product Owner / CEO

- **Name:** Mark Kelly
- **Role:** Product Owner (PO) and CEO — the human in the loop
- **GitHub:** markjkelly
- **Email:** markjkelly@google.com
- **Git config:** Always use `git -c user.name="Mark Kelly" -c user.email="markjkelly@google.com"` for commits so authorship is consistent in history.


## Version Control

- **Commit frequently** — after each meaningful change (new feature, bug fix, refactor, config change). Small, focused commits over large monolithic ones.
- **Write verbose commit messages** — first line is a concise summary (imperative mood, under 72 chars), followed by a blank line and a detailed body explaining *what* changed and *why*. Include context that won't be obvious from the diff.
- **Never commit secrets** — `.gitignore` protects `*-sa-key.json` and `.env`. Verify with `git status` before committing.
- **Review before pushing** — use `git diff --staged` to review staged changes before committing.
- **Keep `main` stable** — use feature branches for non-trivial work, merge back to `main` when ready.
- **Tag milestones** — use annotated git tags for significant releases or milestones.
- **Pull Request Best Practices** — When opening PRs, follow GitHub guidelines:
  - **Write small, focused PRs** with a single purpose to make reviews faster and less bug-prone.
  - **Provide context & guidance**: Write clear titles/descriptions including purpose, overview of changes, and links to context. If multiple files are changed, guide reviewers on the order of review.
  - **Self-review first**: Review, build, and test your own PR before requesting reviews.
  - **Review for security**: Check dependency changes for vulnerabilities, consult the Advisory Database, and resolve security workflow check failures early.
  - **Link related issues & track progress**: Link issues using keywords (e.g., `Closes #NNN`) and use status labels (e.g., ready for review, in progress, blocked).

## Progress Journaling

- **Always update docs/PROGRESS.md** at the end of every session with:
  - Date and session number
  - What was accomplished (with specifics — files changed, features added, bugs fixed)
  - Key decisions made and rationale
  - Next steps / open items
- Commit the docs/PROGRESS.md update as part of the session's final commit

## Team Workflow

This project uses a single sequential pipeline agent (Gemini 3.5 Flash) for all implementation work.

### Feedback → Pipeline → Release

**This is the mandatory workflow for all user feedback and requests:**

1. **PO** provides feedback, feature requests, or bug reports to the orchestrator
2. **Orchestrator** spawns a single pipeline agent (`model: "gemini-3.5-flash"`) with full pipeline instructions
3. **Pipeline agent** executes all steps sequentially: spec → backlog → implement → test → QA → backlog update → progress → release notes → PR
4. **Orchestrator** relays the agent's summary (PR URL, version, what changed) to the PO
5. **PO approves** → orchestrator (or pipeline agent) merges PR, creates git tag, pushes

**Every piece of feedback goes through this pipeline — no skipping steps.**

**Always use the pipeline for all bug fixes and new features — never ask the PO for confirmation on whether to use the pipeline. Just do it.**

### Agent-Only Execution Rule (Non-Negotiable)

**All project work must be performed by a pipeline agent.** The orchestrator (main Gemini/Antigravity context) never writes application code or project docs directly — it always delegates to a single pipeline agent. The only files the orchestrator may edit directly are `AGENTS.md` (project instructions) and memory files.

### Single Sequential Pipeline Agent

**All pipeline work is executed by one agent using `model: "gemini-3.5-flash"`.** This agent plays all roles in sequence — PM, TPM, SWE, SWE-Test, SWE-QA — within a single run, eliminating inter-agent coordination overhead.

**How to spawn the pipeline agent:**

```
Agent(
  description: "Pipeline: <feature slug>",
  model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
  prompt: "<full pipeline instructions — see Mandatory Development Pipeline below>"
)
```

The agent runs in the background. The orchestrator waits for the agent to complete and return a summary, then relays the result to the PO.

### Mandatory Development Pipeline (Non-Negotiable)

**All PO feedback and feature requests MUST follow this pipeline — no shortcuts, no exceptions.**

The pipeline agent executes all steps sequentially in a single run:

1. **Spec**: Create a product spec in `docs/specs/F-NNNN-slug.md` (copy from `docs/specs/TEMPLATE.md`) with requirements and acceptance criteria. Use the next available F-number from `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
2. **Backlog**: Add a work item to `docs/BACKLOG.md` referencing the spec, marked In Progress.
3. **Implement**: Create a feature branch `feature/<slug>`, make all code/config changes.
4. **Test**: Add or update tests in `workstation-image/boot/10-tests.sh` to cover the change.
5. **QA**: Read and verify the implementation is correct; confirm all affected files are updated.
6. **Backlog update**: Mark the backlog item as completed, tested, and verified.
7. **Progress**: Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with session number, date, what was done, decisions, and next steps.
8. **Release notes**: Add a new patch/minor version entry to `docs/RELEASENOTES.md`.
9. **Commit & PR**: Commit all changes on the feature branch (verbose message, no Co-Authored-By trailers), push, open a PR against `main`.
10. **Report**: Return a concise summary to the orchestrator: what changed, PR URL, version number.

After PO approval the orchestrator (or pipeline agent if re-invoked) merges the PR, tags the release (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`), and pushes the tag.

**Mandatory updates every milestone:** docs/BACKLOG.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/RELEASENOTES.md. Git tags MUST be created for every release.

**No live-only fixes:** ALL changes — including quick fixes, config edits, and "just this one thing" — MUST be committed to the repo AND verified through the setup pipeline (`cloud-build-setup.sh`). A change that works on the live system but isn't in the setup script is NOT done.

**Push before teardown/setup:** Always `git push` before running `ws.sh setup` so Cloud Build pulls the latest code.

**Violating this pipeline is a process failure.** If time pressure tempts a shortcut, stop and confirm with the PO first.

### Persistence Across Reboots & Rebuilds (Non-Negotiable)

**Every config change must survive three scenarios: reboot, teardown+setup, and fresh project setup.**

The workstation has TWO config systems that can conflict:
1. **Nix Home Manager** (`~/.config/home-manager/home.nix` + `sway-config`) — runs on every boot via `07-apps.sh` → `home-manager switch`. Creates symlinks to Nix store, **overwriting manual changes**.
2. **Boot scripts** (`~/boot/*.sh`) — run on every boot via `setup.sh`. Deploy configs, install tools.

**Rules for making changes persist:**

1. **Single source of truth**: The repo at `workstation-image/` is the ONLY source of truth for all configs (sway, wofi, swaybar, snippets, boot scripts)
2. **Three places must be updated for every config change**:
   - The **repo config** (e.g., `workstation-image/configs/sway/config`)
   - The **home-manager source** (e.g., `~/.config/home-manager/sway-config`) — must match the repo config exactly, or Home Manager will overwrite with stale version on next boot
   - The **setup script** (`scripts/cloud-build-setup.sh`) — must deploy the config for fresh project setups
3. **Home Manager sway-config MUST match repo sway config**: After any change to `workstation-image/configs/sway/config`, the same change must be applied to `~/.config/home-manager/sway-config` on ALL active workstations
4. **Boot scripts on disk MUST match repo**: After any change to `workstation-image/boot/*.sh`, copy the updated scripts to `~/boot/` on ALL active workstations
5. **Test persistence**: After making changes, verify they survive by running `home-manager switch` and `swaymsg reload` — if the change disappears, it's not persistent
6. **Never edit live-only**: Editing `~/.config/sway/config` directly is useless — it's a symlink to the Nix store managed by Home Manager. Always edit the source at `~/.config/home-manager/sway-config`

### Mandatory Test Coverage (Non-Negotiable)

**Every feature, keybinding, config, and tool MUST have a corresponding test in the boot test script (`workstation-image/boot/10-tests.sh`).**

When adding or changing ANY of the following, you MUST also add or update a test:
- **Keybindings**: Verify the binding exists in the sway config (grep check)
- **App installs**: Verify the binary is on PATH (`which` check)
- **Config files**: Verify the file exists and contains expected content
- **Boot scripts**: Verify the script runs without errors
- **Upgrade scripts**: Verify tools are at expected versions after upgrade

The test script runs on every boot and saves results to:
- `~/logs/boot-test-results.txt` — full PASS/FAIL details
- `~/logs/boot-test-summary.txt` — one-line summary for quick checking

**The definition of done for any feature includes: test added to `10-tests.sh` and passing.**

When adding or modifying any startup/boot script, you MUST also update `docs/STARTUP_SCRIPTS.md` to reflect the change (new script, changed purpose, new logs, etc.).

### Roles

- **PO / CEO** (Your Name) — Product Owner, the human in the loop. Provides feedback, feature requests, and bug reports. Approves direction, tests the app.
- **Pipeline Agent** (Gemini 3.5 Flash) — Single agent that plays all implementation roles sequentially: PM (spec), TPM (backlog/progress/release notes), SWE (code), SWE-Test (tests), SWE-QA (verification). Spawned by the orchestrator with `model: "gemini-3.5-flash"`.
- **Platform Engineer (PE)** — GCP expert (DevOps + SRE). Owns all infrastructure: Cloud Workstations deployment, Dockerfile, IAM/service accounts, monitoring, billing, troubleshooting via GCP logs, reliability engineering. Spawned as a pipeline agent with `model: "gemini-3.5-flash"` when GCP work is needed.

### Backlog Tracking (Non-Negotiable)

**Every piece of work gets a backlog entry in `docs/BACKLOG.md` — no exceptions.**
Regardless of team size, all features, bug fixes, and enhancements must be tracked in the backlog before implementation begins and updated when completed.

### Other Conventions

- **Branching:** Feature branches (`feature/<name>`) off `main`
- **Platform Engineer (PE) owns all GCP interactions:** Cloud Workstations deployment, Dockerfile, IAM/service accounts, logging, monitoring, billing, reliability, troubleshooting
